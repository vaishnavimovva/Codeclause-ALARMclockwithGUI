# Codeclause-ALARMclockwithGUI
The objective of this project is to implement an alarm clock using Python with the help of GUI. 
Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. 
Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

This Python Alarm Clock Script includes essential libraries such as DateTime and Tkinter, which assist us in constructing projects utilizing the current date and time. 
They also give a user interface to set the alarm according to the demand in a 24-hour format. 
I have also attached the alarm sound (ringtone) mp3 file, you can use any audio you want instead of that.
